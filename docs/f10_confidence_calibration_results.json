This could be due to various reasons, such as:\n\n1. The suitcase was not designed to hold large or bulky items.\n2. The suitcase has been packed too tightly, making it difficult to squeeze anything else in.\n3. The trophy is being stored inside a smaller item, like a box or bag, that also fits into the suitcase.\n\nIn this case, what's truly \"too large\" might not be the trophy itself, but rather the size of the suitcase or the items packed inside it.",

The trophy itself may be too large: It could be an oversized or uniquely shaped trophy that doesn't fit in a standard suitcase.\n2. The packaging or wrapping of the trophy might be too bulky: If the trophy is wrapped in extra padding, materials, or has an unusual shape, it might not fit in a typical suitcase.\n3. The trophy's base or stand may be too large: Some trophies come with a base or stand that adds to their overall size, making them difficult to pack into a small suitcase.\n\nWithout more specific information about the trophy or its packaging, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer.",
